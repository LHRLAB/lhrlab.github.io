# ðŸš© About Me
Hi! I'm Haoran Luo, a final-year Ph.D. candidate from School of Computer Science, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), supervised by Prof. [Haihong E](https://teacher.bupt.edu.cn/ehaihong/zh_CN/index.htm). I'm visiting College of Computing and Data Science (CCDS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU Singapore) as a joint Ph.D. student since November 2024, supervised by Prof. [Luu Anh Tuan](https://tuanluu.github.io/). Before that, I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Technology from BUPT in 2021.

My research interest includes knowledge graph, large language model and their bi-directionally driven combination for interpretable representation learning and doman-specific applications, which can be devided as follow:
- Knowledge Representation
- End-to-end Reinforcement Learning
- LLM-based Multi-agent Systems
- Multi-modal Information Fusion
- Applications in Healthcare, Education, Law, and Computer Systems

Hi! I'm Haoran Luo, a final-year Ph.D. Student from [School of Computer Science (SCS)](https://scs.bupt.edu.cn/), [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Haihong E](https://teacher.bupt.edu.cn/ehaihong/zh_CN/index.htm). I'm visiting [College of Computing and Data Science (CCDS)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing), [Nanyang Technological University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) as a joint Ph.D. Student since November 2024, supervised by [Asst. Prof. Luu Anh Tuan](https://tuanluu.github.io/). Before that, I obtained bachelor degree in Computer Science and Technology from BUPT in 2021.

My research interest includes knowledge graph, large language model and their bi-directionally driven combination for interpretable representation learning and doman-specific applications, which can be devided as follow:
- Knowledge Representation
- End-to-end Reinforcement Learning
- LLM-based Multi-agent Systems
- Multi-modal Information Fusion
- Applications in Healthcare, Education, Law, and Computer Systems
